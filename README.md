Naming conventions
==================

It is required from all employees to follow these document naming conventions.

  YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD_Document_name
  ^        ^        ^
  |        |         \___ Any human-friendly label.
  |         \____________ The date in the YYYYMMDD format when the document was
  |                        created. Can be omitted if it is reasonably close to
  |                        the date of creation of the document and there is no
  |                        risk of ambiguity. Can be approximate if the precise
  |                        date is not known.
   \_____________________ The date in the YYYYMMDD format when the document was
                           received by the N.I.D.
