Program Door To Heaven - The Taylor Series
==========================================

This is a StarGate fan fiction.
The premise is that an N.I.D. employee (Taylor Jones)
is going through all available documents about the StarGate program.

I'm aiming to:

* Provide a brand-new point of view to the old stories we all love.
  But keep that compatible with the SG canon.
    * This will be challenging with the time-travel parts.
      I mean most of them didn't happen.
* Slightly educate on various topics and broaden the reader's horizons.
    * If you get fed up with the thoughts and stories of Taylor Jones,
      you can always ignore them and only read the "documents".
* Stay in-character - I'm writing this 30 years after the events,
  so I have to check what knowledge is too modern and what Taylor Jones could have known back then.
    * Like for example, I wanted to compare hieroglyphs to emojis in 1994, but the first set of emojis was from 1999.
* Make as many Indiana Jones crossovers as possible.
    * This gets difficult outside the 1930s.
      Suggestions wanted.
    * There will also be Easter Eggs for other fandoms.
      Like math...
* Be funny or at least entertaining.
    * Primarily for myself, but hopefully also for you.

My goal is not quantity, but rather enjoying the process.
So there might be just a few episodes released per year.
This also depends on how many other side projects I currently have and how much I enjoy them.
