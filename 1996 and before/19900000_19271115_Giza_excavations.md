Alright, another report to read.
After this one, I can finally go for lunch.

Excavation Report
=================

Location: Giza Plateau, Egypt

Date: November 15, 1927

Prepared by: Prof. Paul Langford, Lead Archaeologist

Introduction
------------

The excavation at the Giza Plateau, conducted from July 1 to November 15, 1927,
aimed to uncover and document artifacts and structures from the Old Kingdom
period. The focus of this season's work was the area adjacent to the Great
Pyramid of Khufu, where previous surveys indicated the presence of significant
archaeological features.

Just what I always wanted to do with my international law degree — read about ancient history.
Because, you know, I couldn't get enough of it in high school.
I mean, why bother teaching us about anything other than Middle Age France and Britain, right?
It's not like there was a whole world out there or anything.
And don't even get me started on the lack of anything about what was happening
before Columbus decided to take a wrong turn and bump into America.
But hey, who needs to know about the people who were already here, right?

But, you know, every task is an opportunity to learn something new. 
I might not have chosen this path, but it's a chance to expand my knowledge.

Who knows? Maybe I'll actually learn something interesting.
Maybe I'll find out about a civilization I never knew existed,
or discover a story that makes me see history in a whole new light.

Or maybe I'll just fall asleep halfway through and wake up with drool on my desk.
Either way, I better get started.
And if I do fall asleep, that's okay too.
It's important to listen to my body and take breaks when needed.
Hm, maybe rather after the lunch.
I have some more archeology reports in my backlog that I can fall asleep on later.

Objectives
----------

1. To uncover and document any structures or artifacts related to the Old
   Kingdom period.
2. To gain a better understanding of the daily life and funerary practices of
   the ancient Egyptians.
3. To preserve and catalog any findings for further study and public
   exhibition.

Methodology
-----------

The excavation followed standard archaeological practices of the modern time,
including careful stratigraphic excavation, documentation through photography
and sketching, and meticulous cataloging of artifacts. The site was divided into
a grid system to ensure systematic exploration and recording.

Findings
--------

Structures

Tomb Complex: A previously unknown tomb complex was uncovered approximately
200 meters east of the Great Pyramid. The complex includes a main burial
chamber, two smaller chambers likely used for offerings, and a corridor lined
with hieroglyphic inscriptions.
See the details in Appendix A-1.

Workers' Quarters: Evidence of workers' quarters was found to the south of the
tomb complex. These structures provide insight into the living conditions of the
laborers who built the pyramids.
See the details in Appendix A-2.

Artifacts

Pottery: Numerous fragments of pottery were recovered, including storage jars,
beer vessels, and fineware bowls. These artifacts are currently being
reconstructed and analyzed.
See the details in Appendix B-1.

Tools: A variety of tools, including copper chisels, stone hammers, and flint
knives, were discovered in the workers' quarters. These tools offer clues about
the construction techniques used in the building of the pyramids.
See the details in Appendix B-2.

Jewelry and Amulets: Several pieces of jewelry and amulets were found within the
tomb complex. These items, made of gold, lapis lazuli, and carnelian, are
indicative of the wealth and status of the individuals buried there.
See the details in Appendix B-3.

Inscriptions: The corridor of the tomb complex is lined with hieroglyphic
inscriptions. These inscriptions are being translated and are expected to
provide valuable information about the occupants of the tomb and the religious
practices of the time.
See the details in Appendix B-4.

Significant Discoveries
-----------------------

Burial Chamber: The main burial chamber contained the remains of a high-ranking
official, identified by an inscribed cartouche as "Nebkaure." The chamber also
contained a sarcophagus, canopic jars, and a variety of funerary goods.

Offering Chambers: The two smaller chambers adjacent to the burial chamber were
found to contain remnants of food offerings, including grains, fruits, and
animal bones. These findings shed light on the funerary rituals and beliefs of
the ancient Egyptians.

See the details in Appendix A-1.

Challenges
----------

Environmental Conditions: The excavation was hampered by occasional sandstorms
and high temperatures, which affected the pace of work and the preservation of
some artifacts.

Logistical Issues: Transporting equipment and supplies to the site proved
challenging, requiring the use of local labor and animals.

Conclusion
----------

The 1927 excavation season at the Giza Plateau has yielded significant findings
that enhance our understanding of the Old Kingdom period. The discovery of the
tomb complex and associated artifacts provides valuable insights into the
funerary practices, daily life, and social structure of ancient Egyptian
society. Further analysis and study of the findings are ongoing, and it is
anticipated that these discoveries will contribute greatly to the field of
Egyptology.

Recommendations
---------------

1. Continue excavation and documentation of the tomb complex and workers'
   quarters in the next season.
2. Conduct further analysis of the hieroglyphic inscriptions to fully understand
   their significance.
3. Preserve and catalog all artifacts for future study and public exhibition.

Nothing interesting here.
I guess my boss won't notice if I skip the complete catalogue of findings in the appendices.
Let's call it "applying the Pareto principle".
A hundred years ago, Mr. Pareto noticed that 80% of Italian wealth is owned by 20% of people.
Fifty years later, another guy came across Pareto's notes and generalized the principle to something like:
"80% of the results stem from 20% of the causes".
And my favourite usage is that 80% of my work results are accomplished in 20% of the spent time.
I could keep chasing the remaining 20% of results, but that would require spending 5 times that amount of time.
