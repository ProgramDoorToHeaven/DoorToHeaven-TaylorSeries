Discovery and initial analysis of the circular artifacts
========================================================

Location: Giza Plateau, Egypt

Date: September 8, 1928

Prepared by: Prof. Paul Langford, Lead Archaeologist

Introduction
------------

A significant archaeological discovery was made near the Great Pyramids in Giza,
Egypt. This report details the unearthing and initial analysis of a large,
circular artifact found beneath a cover stone, accompanied by 2 buried human
bodies in ritual armor with jackal heads and decorated staffs.

Ok, that must be the artifact this program is interested in.
But since when is our military interested in ancient history?

Discovery
---------

While leading an archaeological expedition near the Great Pyramids, my team and
I uncovered a large, circular artifact buried beneath a substantial cover stone.
Accompanying the artifact were two remains of human bodies, which we initially
hypothesized could be remnants of an ancient burial ritual or guardians of the
artifact. The artifact itself is composed of what appears to be a melted
meteorite, exhibiting a metallic structure unlike any known materials from the
historical or geological record.

Maybe the military isn't interested in history, but rather in the material?

Initial Analysis
----------------

Material Composition

Preliminary analysis of the artifact indicates that it is composed of a unique
metallic substance, potentially from a melted meteorite. The material exhibits
unusual properties, and further study is required to fully understand its
composition and potential origins.

It weighs around 30 000 kg and its diameter is 6.7 m.
```

That's 65 000 pounds and 22 feet in the imperial units. 
Egypt switched to the metric system in 1891.
And Germany (where prof. Langford was from) has been using metric since 1870s.
The whole world went crazy and switched to this abstract system instead of the natural and relatable one.

I mean scientists like the metric system because of the ease of conversion between units.
And that is probably the reason why most of the world adopted it.
We even had the Metric Conversion Act of 1975 as an effort to join the rest of the world. 
It established the U.S. Metric Board, which was tasked with coordinating and planning the voluntary conversion to the metric system.
But it was just voluntary and the general public did not feel a pressing need to change their everyday measurement habits.
So the Board was eventually disbanded in 1982 due to lack of progress and funding.

And here I am. 
Tasked with auditing military programs, tracking their progress and suggesting changes to their funding.
Keeping the national expenses efficient and preventing wasting of taxpayer's money. 
So I hope the Air Force has some break through with the materials, and they already started experimenting with new stealth bombers or fighters made of something based on this Egyptian metallurgy.

Symbol Inscription

The artifact is inscribed with a series of complex symbols arranged in a
circular pattern around its perimeter. These symbols do not correspond to any
known ancient writing systems. Linguists and cryptographers are currently
attempting to decipher their meaning and possible significance.

The cover stone's outer ring depicts the artifact with it's symbols. Inside the
artifact depiction on the cover stone, there are early hieroglyphic
inscriptions. In the center, there is an ornamental cartouche with 6 of the
symbols from the outer ring.

We are excited by the new unknown symbols. They could be a writing system of an
older civilization and the hieroglyphics accompanying them would typically be
their translation.

None of the symbols on the artifact is used twice. This indicates a logographic
writing system. The text contains 39 distinct symbols. Therefore, we expect the
whole writing system to use thousands of different symbols. The cartouche in the
middle is probably a summary or a headline containing the most important words
from the text.

Buried guardians

The two buried bodies were discovered with unhealed broken bones, suggesting
they may have met a violent end. Their jackal masks are made of metal and they
contain mechanical parts which used to move. The ornamental staffs are well
preserved and don't have any sharp edges. Although they could be used as blunt
weapons, their primary use was probably purely decorative or an indication of
social status.

Archaeological Context
----------------------

The presence of the two guardians alongside the artifact suggests a possible
ceremonial or protective role. They might have died protecting the artifact or
in a brutal sacrificial ritual. Further investigation is needed to determine
their exact nature and relationship to the artifact.

Conclusion
----------

The discovery of this artifact represents a significant advancement in our
understanding of ancient metallurgy and symbolism. Further interdisciplinary
research is essential to unravel the mysteries surrounding its origin and
purpose.

Recommendations
---------------

- Establish a dedicated research team comprising archaeologists, linguists,
  material scientists, and historians.
- Conduct non-invasive imaging and analysis to preserve the artifact's
  integrity.
- Explore potential connections to other archaeological sites and historical
  records that may provide additional context.
