Discovery and initial analysis of the circular artifacts
========================================================

Location: Giza Plateau, Egypt

Date: September 8, 1928

Prepared by: Prof. Paul Langford, Lead Archaeologist

Introduction
------------

A significant archaeological discovery was made near the Great Pyramids in Giza, Egypt. This report details the unearthing and initial analysis of a large, circular artifact found beneath a cover stone, accompanied by 2 buried human bodies in ritual armor with jackal heads and decorated staffs.

Discovery
---------

While leading an archaeological expedition near the Great Pyramids, my team and I uncovered a large, circular artifact buried beneath a substantial cover stone. Accompanying the artifact were two remains of human bodies, which we initially hypothesized could be remnants of an ancient burial ritual or guardians of the artifact. The artifact itself is composed of what appears to be a melted meteorite, exhibiting a metallic structure unlike any known materials from the historical or geological record.

Initial Analysis
----------------

Material Composition

Preliminary analysis of the artifact indicates that it is composed of a unique metallic substance, potentially from a melted meteorite. The material exhibits unusual properties, and further study is required to fully understand its composition and potential origins.

Symbol Inscription

The artifact is inscribed with a series of complex symbols arranged in a circular pattern around its perimeter. These symbols do not correspond to any known ancient writing systems. Linguists and cryptographers are currently attempting to decipher their meaning and possible significance.

The cover stone's outer ring depicts the artifact with it's symbols. Inside the artifact depiction on the cover stone, there are early hieroglyphic inscriptions. In the center, there is an ornamental cartouche with 6 of the symbols from the outer ring.

We are excited by the new unknown symbols. They could be a writing system of an older civilization and the hieroglyphics accompanying them would typically be their translation.

None of the symbols on the artefact is used twice. This indicates a logographic writing system. The text contains 39 distinct symbols. Therefore, we expect the whole writing system to use thousands of different symbols. The cartouche in the middle is probably a summary or a headline containing the most important words from the text.

Buried guardians

The two buried bodies were discovered with unhealed broken bones, suggesting they may have met a violent end. Their jackal masks are made of metal and they contain mechanical parts which used to move. The ornamental staffs don't have any sharp edges. Although they could be used as weapons, their primary use was probably purely decorative or showing their social status.

Archaeological Context
----------------------

The presence of the two guardians alongside the artifact suggests a possible ceremonial or protective role. They might have died protecting the artefact or in a brutal sacrificial ritual. Further investigation is needed to determine their exact nature and relationship to the artifact.

Conclusion
----------

The discovery of this artifact represents a significant advancement in our understanding of ancient metallurgy and symbolism. Further interdisciplinary research is essential to unravel the mysteries surrounding its origin and purpose.

Recommendations
---------------

- Establish a dedicated research team comprising archaeologists, linguists, material scientists, and historians.
- Conduct non-invasive imaging and analysis to preserve the artifact's integrity.
- Explore potential connections to other archaeological sites and historical records that may provide additional context.
