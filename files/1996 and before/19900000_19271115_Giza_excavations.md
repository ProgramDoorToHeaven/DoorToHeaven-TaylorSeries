They assigned me to keep an eye on this new Air Force program.
Like if I already didn't have enough work.

Program "Door to Heaven" - who comes up with these code names?

Alright, another report to read.
Once I’m done with this one, I can finally go for lunch.

Excavation Report
=================

Location: Giza Plateau, Egypt  
Date: November 15, 1927  
Prepared by: Prof. Paul Langford, Lead Archaeologist

Introduction
------------

The excavation at the Giza Plateau, conducted from July 1 to November 15, 1927,
aimed to uncover and document artifacts and structures from the Old Kingdom
period. This season's focus was the area adjacent to the Great Pyramid of Khufu,
where earlier surveys had suggested the presence of significant archaeological
features.

Reading a report on Egyptian excavations isn’t exactly what I pictured when I got my international law degree—but it’s
an interesting detour.
Ancient history wasn’t my strongest subject in school.
I always wondered why the curriculum obsessed over medieval Europe and barely touched the rest of the world.
And there’s so much more beyond what happened after Columbus.

Still, every new task is a chance to learn something unexpected.
Maybe I’ll discover a civilization I’ve never heard of, or stumble across a detail that changes how I see the past.
If nothing else, it’s a break from the usual.

And if I doze off? No judgment.
Some of my best ideas arrive after a good nap—or so I tell myself.
For now, I’ll give it a fair shot.
Who knows? I might even enjoy it.
And if I don’t fall asleep during this one, there’s always the rest of the archaeology backlog… but that can wait until
after lunch.

Objectives
----------

1. Uncover and document any structures or artifacts related to the Old Kingdom.
2. Better understand the daily life and funerary practices of the ancient
   Egyptians.
3. Preserve and catalog all findings for further study and public exhibition.

Methodology
-----------

The excavation followed the standard archaeological practices of the modern
time: careful stratigraphic excavation, documentation through photography and
sketches, and meticulous cataloging of artifacts. The site was divided into a
grid system to ensure systematic exploration and recording.

Findings
--------

Structures

Tomb Complex: A previously unknown tomb complex was uncovered approximately 200
meters east of the Great Pyramid. It includes a main burial chamber, two smaller
offering chambers, and a corridor lined with hieroglyphic inscriptions.  
See Appendix A-1.

Workers' Quarters: Evidence of workers' quarters was found south of the tomb
complex, offering insight into the living conditions of pyramid laborers.  
See Appendix A-2.

Artifacts

Pottery: Numerous pottery fragments were recovered—storage jars, beer vessels,
and fineware bowls—now being reconstructed and analyzed.  
See Appendix B-1.

Tools: A variety of tools—copper chisels, stone hammers, flint knives—were found
in the workers' quarters, offering clues about pyramid construction techniques.  
See Appendix B-2.

Jewelry and Amulets: Several pieces of gold, lapis lazuli, and carnelian jewelry
were found in the tomb complex, indicating the wealth and status of the buried
individuals.  
See Appendix B-3.

Inscriptions: The corridor of the tomb is lined with hieroglyphs, currently
being translated to reveal details about the tomb's occupants and their
religious practices.  
See Appendix C-1.

Significant Discoveries
-----------------------

Burial Chamber: Contained the remains of a high-ranking official, identified by
an inscribed cartouche as "Nebkaure", along with a sarcophagus, canopic jars,
and various funerary goods.

Offering Chambers: Contained remnants of food offerings—grains, fruits, and
animal bones—shedding light on funerary rituals and beliefs.  
See Appendix A-1.

Challenges
----------

Environmental Conditions: Sandstorms and high temperatures slowed the work and
threatened artifact preservation.

Logistical Issues: Transporting equipment and supplies was difficult, requiring
local labor and animal transport.

Conclusion
----------

The 1927 excavation season yielded significant insights into Old Kingdom life.
The tomb complex and associated artifacts provide valuable information about
funerary practices, daily life, and social structure in ancient Egypt. Further
study is ongoing, with expectations that these findings will greatly contribute
to Egyptology.

Recommendations
---------------

1. Continue excavation and documentation in the next season.
2. Complete translation of hieroglyphic inscriptions.
3. Preserve and catalog all artifacts for future study and public display.

Nothing earth-shattering here.
I doubt my boss will notice if I skip the full catalog of findings in the appendices.
Let’s call it “applying the Pareto principle.”

A century ago, Vilfredo Pareto observed that 80% of Italy’s wealth belonged to 20% of its people.
Fifty years later, someone generalized it into: 80% of results come from 20% of causes.
My favorite spin: 80% of my work gets done in 20% of my time.
Chasing the remaining 20% of results would take five times longer—and probably isn’t worth it.
