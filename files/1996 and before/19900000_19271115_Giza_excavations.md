They assigned me to keep an eye on this new Air Force program.
Like if I already didn't have enough work.

Program "Door to Heaven" - who comes up with these code names?
Anyways, ethymology is fun.
Probably something about flying to the sky.
What else could it mean?

Alright, another report to read.
Once I’m done with this one, I can finally go for lunch.

Archaeological Report: Discovery of the Tomb of Queen Meresankh III
===================================================================

Location: Giza Plateau, East Field, Egypt  
Date of Discovery: April 1927
Excavation Director: George Andrew Reisner, Ph.D
Report prepared by: Prof. Paul Langford, Deputy Field Director

Introduction
------------

On April 23, 1927, during systematic excavations in the East Field of the Giza
necropolis, the entrance to a previously unknown mastaba tomb was uncovered. The
tomb was identified as belonging to Queen Meresankh III, granddaughter of
Pharaoh Khufu and wife of Pharaoh Khafre, based on inscriptions found within the
structure.

Reading a report on Egyptian excavations isn’t exactly what I pictured when I got my international law degree—but it’s an interesting detour.
Ancient history wasn’t my strongest subject in school.
I always wondered why the curriculum obsessed over medieval Europe and barely touched the rest of the world or what happened here before Columbus.

The only pyramids I've learnt about were ones like the Ponzi scheme.
Coincidentally, Mr. Ponzi carried out his fraud as well in the 1920s.
His pyramid scheme was neither the first one, nor the last one, but he got a lot of media attention, because it was colossal. 
His business started legitimately as investing in international postage stamps... or something like that.
But soon he realized it wasn't feasible and the only way to keep looking profitable was too pay interests to the old investors directly from the money his new investors invested.

In general, this is how a pyramid scheme works:
They offer you an investment opportunity with suspiciously high and stable interest rate and little or even no risk at all.
They have no financial institution license, but they have a new secret complicated idea that promises a lot of money.
The early investors get their promised money.
That lures new investors and the pyramid can start.
The earlier investors get paid interests from the money of the new investors, and it works as long as each new level of the pyramid has more members than the previous ones. 
The problems start once you decide to withdraw your investment. 
There simply is not that much money available for everyone to withdraw. 
And once the investors don't trust the scheme anymore and start withdrawing their money,
the fraudster packs the rest of the money in a suitcase and buys a one-way ticket for a flight to some exotic island which has no international treaty on extradition of criminals.

Back to the Egyptian pyramids.
I hope I won't fall asleep on the report.
I don't want to sleep over my lunch break.
I already arranged a lunch with my colleague Youssef who is interested in history and his parents come from Egypt.
So he might have some insight.

Discovery and Initial Observations
----------------------------------

The tomb, designated G 7530-7540, was located near the pyramid complex of
Khafre. The entrance was sealed with a limestone slab, indicating the tomb had
remained undisturbed since its original sealing. Upon entry, the team discovered
a descending corridor leading to a series of decorated chambers.

Methodology
-----------

The excavation followed the standard archaeological practices of the modern
time: careful stratigraphic excavation, documentation through photography and
sketches, and meticulous cataloging of artifacts. The site was divided into a
grid system to ensure systematic exploration and recording.

Findings
--------

Chambers and Artifacts

Antechamber: The walls were adorned with finely carved reliefs depicting Queen
Meresankh III in ceremonial poses, accompanied by hieroglyphic inscriptions
invoking offerings and protection. The reliefs were remarkably well-preserved,
with traces of original paint still visible.
See appendix A-1.

Burial Chamber: The sarcophagus, made of black granite and decorated with palace
façade motifs, was found intact. Inside, the remains of the queen were
discovered, along with a variety of funerary goods:
- Jewelry: Gold bracelets, necklaces, and a pectoral bearing the queen’s
  cartouche.
- Statues: Alabaster and limestone statues of the queen, including a notable
  statue depicting her mother, Queen Hetepheres II, embracing her.
- Canopic Jars: Among the earliest known examples, these jars were inscribed
  with the queen’s titles and contained her viscerally preserved organs.
See appendices B-1 to B-4.

Inscription Chamber: A stela was found detailing Meresankh III’s lineage,
confirming her as the daughter of Prince Kawab and Queen Hetepheres II, and the
wife of Khafre. This stela provided critical genealogical information about the
Fourth Dynasty royal family.
See appendix C-1.

Significance
------------

The discovery of Meresankh III’s tomb is of profound historical importance. It
offers unique insights into the role of royal women in the Old Kingdom and
provides tangible evidence of the dynastic connections between Khufu, Khafre,
and their descendants. The artifacts and inscriptions found within the tomb are
invaluable for understanding the funerary practices and royal lineage of the
Fourth Dynasty.

Conclusion
----------

The tomb of Queen Meresankh III remains one of the most significant
archaeological finds from the Giza plateau so far. The preservation of the tomb
and its contents has allowed scholars to reconstruct aspects of royal life,
religion, and artistry during the Old Kingdom.

Nothing earth-shattering here.
I doubt my boss will notice if I skip the full catalog of findings in the appendices.
Let’s call it “applying the Pareto principle.”

A century ago, Vilfredo Pareto observed that 80% of Italy’s wealth belonged to 20% of its people.
Fifty years later, someone generalized it into: 80% of results come from 20% of causes.
My favorite spin: 80% of my work gets done in 20% of my time.
Chasing the remaining 20% of results would take five times longer—and probably isn’t worth it.

When I asked about these archeologists, Youssef told me, they parted ways after the 1927 season. 
Dr. Reisner continued what he was doing before - digging mummies from the sand. 
Prof. Langford also tried digging (on another part of the Giza plateau) for one year.
After that he spent 10 years researching and cataloging artifacts in the museum of Cairo.
Before the war, he moved to the States and did some minor research here that noone ever heard about.

Youssef suggests that prof. Langford probably met the classical fate of all Egyptologists.
Once everything was discovered in Giza, there was not much money to be made from new artifacts.
All the famous Egyptologists started teaching Egyptology to young students. 
After some time in the field, the students found out what was going on and that their only way to earn money in Egyptology was to get a Ph.D. and start teaching as well. 
And that's how Egyptology became a pyramid scheme.
