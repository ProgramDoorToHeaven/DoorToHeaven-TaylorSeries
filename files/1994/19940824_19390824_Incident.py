They dial in the evening, spend approx 1.5 days on Abbydos, return August 24-ish

Well, I guess they were lucky.
Whatever it was they were working on ended up killing that Nazi [Heinrich, burnt wound on his chest],
and, apparently, wiped both of their memories.
The doctor did seem convinced that the memory loss was genuine.
that cable that we intercepted from Berlin, suggests these Germans are keen to acquire whatever this thing is.
You're certain you never encountered our missing British officer, Captain James Beal?
What about Wasif Alabu Khan. [Egyptian soldier]
He isn't the type to simply go AWOL.
If you can remember anything, please contact the British Embassy when you arrive in the States.
Apparently the Germans have been funding them for years...

- A German soldier, identified as **Heinrich** (last name, unit, rank), was found deceased with severe burns on his chest. The cause of death appears linked to an unidentified experiment with the device.
- The nature of the device remains unknown, but its effects suggest advanced and potentially hazardous technology.

- A **cable intercepted from Berlin** indicates that German authorities are **actively seeking to acquire the device**. The urgency and tone of the communication suggest its strategic importance.

#### **4. Missing British and Egyptian Personnel**
- **Captain James Beal**, a British officer, remains unaccounted for. His whereabouts and potential involvement in the incident are unknown.
- **Wasif Alabu Khan**, an Egyptian soldier, is also missing. His disappearance is considered highly irregular, as he is not known to be the type to go AWOL.

#### **5. German Funding of Foreign Operations**

### **Recommendations**
1. **Immediate Investigation:** A full inquiry must be launched to locate Captain Beal and Wasif Alabu Khan, and to determine their connection to the incident.
2. **Device Recovery:** Efforts should be prioritized to locate and secure the unidentified device before German forces acquire it.
