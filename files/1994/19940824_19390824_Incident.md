BRITISH INTELLIGENCE REPORT
===========================

Date:             24 August 1939
Classification:   CONFIDENTIAL
From:             British Intelligence, Field Operative
To:               Director of Naval Intelligence, London

Incident Summary
----------------

On August 24, 1939, British operatives encountered a highly unusual and
concerning situation involving German nationals, a missing British officer, and
a huge ring artefact. The following details have been compiled from intercepted
communications, field reports, and witness testimony.

Key Findings
------------

Fatality of a German officer

- A German officer, partially identified as Schutzstaffel Obersturmführer
  Heinrich (last name unknown), was found deceased with severe burns on the
  right side of his chest. The cause of death appears linked to an experiment
  with the artifact. The damage was likely caused by an electrical current,
  since the ring was connected to a car generator via cables.
- Unfortunately, he had his ID documents in the shirt pocket which was burned.
  Only a part of his dog tag remained readable.

Missing British and Egyptian personnel

- Captain James Beal, a British officer, remains unaccounted for. He was
  stationed in a nearby outpost. His whereabouts and potential involvement in
  the incident are unknown.
- Wasif Alabu Khan, an Egyptian soldier assigned to the same outpost, is also
  missing. His disappearance is considered highly irregular, as he is not known
  to be the type to go AWOL.

Memory loss among German researchers

- Two German researchers involved in the incident (prof. Paul Langford and his
  daughter Catherine Langford) exhibited genuine memory loss covering the last
  two days, as confirmed by a medical professional. The suspected cause is the
  psychological shock triggered by the German officer’s death.
- The researchers were unable to provide further details regarding the
  experiment or the artifact. They discovered it 10 years ago on the Giza
  plateau, and have been researching it since then without any significant
  progress. They couldn't recall why it had been connected to the electrical
  source.

Intercepted German communication

- A radio cable intercepted from Berlin indicates that German authorities are
  actively seeking to acquire the artifact. The urgency and tone of the
  communication suggest its strategic importance.

German funding of foreign operations

- Evidence suggests that German authorities have been funding foreign
  archeological and research operatives in this area for years.

Recommendations
---------------

1) Immediate investigation: A full inquiry must be launched to locate Captain
   Beal and Wasif Alabu Khan, and to determine their connection to the incident.
   The German embassy in Cairo must be contacted regarding the death of one of
   their officers.
2) Artifact recovery: The artifact remains at the incident site. Immediate
   action is required to secure and transport it to the United States where
   prof. Langford will continue his research supervised by the U.S. intelligence
   agencies. Given the escalating tensions in Europe and the German interest in
   acquiring the artifact, its recovery must be treated with the utmost urgency
   to prevent it from being compromised.
3) Monitor German Activity: Increased surveillance of German communications and
   operatives is recommended to track their movements and intentions.
4) Collaboration with Allies: Coordinate with Egyptian authorities and other
   allies to gather additional intelligence on German-funded operations in the
   region.

Conclusion
----------

The incident suggests the existence of a dangerous experimental German project,
with potential implications for British and Allied security. The disappearance
of British and Egyptian personnel, combined with German efforts to recover the
artifact, underscores the urgency of this matter.

All operatives are instructed to report any further developments immediately to
the British Embassy or relevant intelligence channels.
