Torment of Tantalus
It wasn't until 1945 when President Roosevelt gave funding for Professor Langford to study the stargate. The President thought that the device might be a weapon.
Expected to be a weapon as it killed a nazi and wiped memories of the Langfords.
Langford told Catherine, who was engaged to be married to Ernest, that Ernest had died in an explosion in the lab.
Not long after this, the research project was discontinued and the stargate was placed in storage in an armory in Washington, D.C. (2.21 "1969").
... The Pentagon found the film from Langford's research and sent it to Stargate Command.
