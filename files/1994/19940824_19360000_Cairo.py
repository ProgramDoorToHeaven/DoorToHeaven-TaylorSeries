A letter to Deitrich:

It's been over 5 years and still no success deciphering.
The ring is precious.
The hieroglyphs say translate to...
Professor Langford had a team of archaeologists and linguists translate the coverstone. They used Budge as a reference and translated the name of the device as "Doorway to Heaven".
Money running out. Translated a Hebrew amulet for a French colleague. Germans started obsessing about various artefacts with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahnenerbe, so they might help financing our research.


Dear Deitrich,

I've been working on the ancient ring for over 5 years and it feels like I haven't moved a bit. 
The only success since it's discovery has been the translation of the hieroglyphs on the cover stone.

... HIEROGLYPHS
... TRANSLATION 

I can feel that it is an important discovery, but without any successful research, it is just an "unknown artifact", a curiosity to hang on a wall and wonder about.
Moreover, it is getting difficult to do any research with expensive equipment or with renowned colleagues when our finding is running dry. 

With my daughter Catherine, we've been living in the warehouse where we have all the artifacts. 
She even got her first part time job - cataloging items at the Cairo museum - to help with our financial situation. 
I've also been doing some odd jobs to get us more money. 
Like last week, I translate some Hebrew inscriptions for some French archeologist.
