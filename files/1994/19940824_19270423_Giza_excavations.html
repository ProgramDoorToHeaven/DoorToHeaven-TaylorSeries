            Just got handed a new Air Force program to monitor - "Door to Heaven".
            Seriously, who names these things?
        </p>
<p>
            The name’s got me curious, though.
            Is it about soaring into the sky?
            What else could it possibly mean?
            Guess I'll find out somewhere in this pile of reports.
        </p>

<p>
            Alright, another report to read.
            Once I'm done with this one, I can finally go for lunch.

===================================================================
</pre>
<pre>Location:              Giza Plateau, East Field, Egypt
Date of Discovery:     April 1927
Excavation Director:   George Andrew Reisner, Ph.D
Report prepared by:    Prof. Paul Langford, Deputy Field Director
</pre>
<pre>Introduction
------------
</pre>
<p>
            On April 23, 1927, during systematic excavations in the East Field of the Giza necropolis,
            the entrance to a previously unknown mastaba tomb was uncovered.
            The tomb was identified as belonging to Queen Meresankh III, granddaughter of Pharaoh Khufu and wife of Pharaoh Khafre, based on inscriptions found within the structure.
        </p></div><div class="thoughts"><p>
            Reading a report on Egyptian excavations isn't exactly what I pictured when I got my international law degree - but it's an interesting detour.
            Ancient history wasn't my strongest subject in school.
            I always wondered why the curriculum obsessed over medieval Europe and barely touched the rest of the world or what happened here before Columbus.
        </p>
<p>
            The only pyramids I've learnt about were ones like the Ponzi scheme.
            Coincidentally, Carlo Ponzi carried out his fraud as well in the 1920s.
            His pyramid scheme was neither the first one, nor the last one, but he got a lot of media attention, because it was colossal.
            His business began legitimately - he claimed to invest in international postage stamps, or something along those lines.
            But he quickly realized the venture wasn't sustainable.
            To maintain the illusion of profitability, he resorted to paying returns to earlier investors using the funds from new ones.
        </p>
<p>
            In general, this is how a pyramid scheme works:
            They offer you an investment opportunity with suspiciously high and stable interest rate and little or even no risk at all.
            They lack proper financial licensing, but they have a new secret complicated idea that supposedly guarantees wealth.
            At first, early investors receive their promised payouts - this builds trust and attracts new participants.
            The scheme grows as each new wave of investors funds the returns for the previous ones.
            As long as the pyramid keeps expanding, with each new layer larger than the last, the illusion holds.
            But the cracks appear when investors try to withdraw their money.
            The scheme simply doesn't have enough funds to cover everyone's payouts.
            Once trust collapses and withdrawals surge, the fraudster vanishes with all the remaining money boarding a one-way flight to an exotic country with no extradition treaty.
        </p>

            Back to the Egyptian pyramids.
            I hope I won't fall asleep on the report.
            I'd rather not spend my lunch break dozing at my desk.
            Luckily, I'm meeting my colleague Youssef for lunch today.
            He's really into history, and since his parents are from Egypt, he might have some interesting insights to share.
        </p></div><div class="typewriter"><pre>Discovery and Initial Observations
----------------------------------
</pre>
<p>
            The tomb, designated G 7530-7540, was located near the pyramid complex of Khafre.
            The entrance was sealed with a limestone slab, indicating the tomb had remained undisturbed since its original sealing.
            Upon entry, the team discovered a descending corridor leading to a series of decorated chambers.
        </p>
<pre>Methodology
-----------
</pre>
<p>
            The excavation followed the standard archaeological practices of the modern time:
            careful stratigraphic excavation, documentation through photography and sketches, and meticulous cataloging of artifacts.
            The site was divided into a grid system to ensure systematic exploration and recording.
        </p>
<pre>Findings
--------
</pre>
<pre>Chambers and Artifacts</pre>
<p>
            Antechamber:
            The walls were adorned with finely carved reliefs depicting Queen Meresankh III in ceremonial poses, accompanied by hieroglyphic inscriptions invoking offerings and protection.
            The reliefs were remarkably well-preserved, with traces of original paint still visible.
        <br/>
            See appendix A-1.
        </p>
<p>
            Burial Chamber: The sarcophagus, made of black granite and decorated with palace façade motifs, was found intact.
            Inside, the remains of the queen were discovered, along with a variety of funerary goods:
        </p><p>- Jewelry: Gold bracelets, necklaces, and a pectoral bearing the queen's cartouche.<br/>- Statues: Alabaster and limestone statues of the queen, including a notable statue depicting her mother, Queen Hetepheres II, embracing her.<br/>- Canopic Jars: Among the earliest known examples, these jars were inscribed with the queen's titles and contained her viscerally preserved organs.</p><p class="omit_space_before">See appendices B-1 to B-4.</p>
<p>
            Inscription Chamber: A stela was found detailing Meresankh III's lineage, confirming her as the daughter of Prince Kawab and Queen Hetepheres II, and the wife of Khafre.
            This stela provided critical genealogical information about the Fourth Dynasty royal family.
        <br/>
            See appendix C-1.
        </p>
<pre>Significance
------------
</pre>
<p>
            The discovery of Meresankh III's tomb is of profound historical importance.
            It offers unique insights into the role of royal women in the Old Kingdom and provides tangible evidence of the dynastic connections between Khufu, Khafre, and their descendants.
            The artifacts and inscriptions found within the tomb are invaluable for understanding the funerary practices and royal lineage of the Fourth Dynasty.
        </p>
<pre>Conclusion
----------
</pre>
<p>
            The tomb of Queen Meresankh III remains one of the most significant archaeological finds from the Giza plateau so far.
            The preservation of the tomb and its contents has allowed scholars to reconstruct aspects of royal life, religion, and artistry during the Old Kingdom.

            Nothing earth-shattering here.
            I doubt my boss will notice if I skip the full catalog of findings in the appendices.
            Let's call it “applying the Pareto principle.”
        </p>
<p>
            A century ago, Vilfredo Pareto observed that 80% of Italy's wealth belonged to 20% of its people.
            Fifty years later, someone generalized it into: 80% of results come from 20% of causes.
            My favorite spin: 80% of my work gets done in 20% of my time.
            Chasing the remaining 20% of results would take five times longer - and probably isn't worth it.

<p>
            In 1927, Dr. Reisner and Prof. Langford conducted an archaeological dig in Egypt.
            No indication of any Air Force-related activity.
        </p>
<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>This document likely requires no access restrictions.</p></div><div class="thoughts"><hr/>
<p>
            When I asked Youssef about these archaeologists, he told me they went their separate ways after the 1927 season.
            Dr. Reisner continued his previous work - excavating mummies and broken vases from the sand.
            Prof. Langford also conducted digs for a year, but on a different part of the Giza plateau.
            After that, he spent a decade researching and cataloging artifacts at the Cairo Museum.
            Just before the war, he moved to the United States, where he carried out some minor research that went largely unnoticed.
            And my gut feeling is that it was classified and never published.
        </p>
<p>
            Youssef suggests that Prof. Langford likely met the classic fate of all Egyptologists and found a better job.
            Once Giza's major discoveries were exhausted, funding for new excavations dried up.
            With little money left in uncovering artifacts, the field's most prominent figures turned to teaching Egyptology at universities.
            It usually takes a year for students to realize the harsh truth:
            the only way to make a living in Egyptology now is to earn a Ph.D. and start teaching the next generation.
            And so, as Youssef puts it, Egyptology became something of a pyramid scheme.
