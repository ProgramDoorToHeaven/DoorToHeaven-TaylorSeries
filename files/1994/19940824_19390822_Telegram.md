That was a week before the start of the second world war (which arrived in Egypt 2 years later in 1940).
Telegrams were quite a common way of fast and reliable communication back then.
I’ve rarely encountered telegrams in my life.
Around 1880, by the time I went to primary school, they were replaced by the more modern fax machine.
Fax usage has been growing steadily, but the rise of internet-based e-mail was even more rapid.
Today, both fax and e-mail are used in roughly equal measure.
