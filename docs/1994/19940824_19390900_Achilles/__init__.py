Captain Mitchell, United States Merchant Marine, Achilles ship
-> Boston, zigzagging all over the Atlantic to make it difficult to U-boats
"torpedo" hole, grandson Cameron Mitchell

Departed 1939-08-25 -ish.

In early 1930s, from Southampton to New York (5'700 km), it took:
    5-7 days for express passenger lines
    7-9 days for regular passenger lines
    10-12 days for cargo and slower ships
In 1939, the Achilles journey from Alexandria to Boston (9'000 km) would be +60% distance going straight.
With zig-zagging through the Atlantic, let's say (10'000 km) +75% distance compared to Southampton -> New York.
We can expect faster ships at the end of 1930s.
So let's say it would be 12-14 days for Achilles going straight and 14-16 days when zig-zagging through the Atlantic.

"We'd be in Boston right now if we weren't zigzagging all over the bloody Atlantic."
That means the Baal boarding hapens near to the end of the journey - arround day 12-14 with 2 days remaining.
There could be some exageration in the statement, so maybo arround day 9-14 with 2-5 days remaining.
That would be 1939-09-03 to 1939-09-08.

France + UK declared war on Germany on 1939-09-03
"We're not at war yet" (= USA entered WW2 in 1941)
