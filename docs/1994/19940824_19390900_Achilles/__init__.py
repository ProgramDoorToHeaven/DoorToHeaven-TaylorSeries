Captain Mitchell, United States Merchant Marine, Achilles ship
-> Boston, zigzagging all over the Atlantic to make it difficult to U-boats
"torpedo" hole, grandson Cameron Mitchell

Departed 1939-08-25 -ish.

In early 1930s, from Southampton to New York (5'700 km), it took:
    5-7 days for express passenger lines
    7-9 days for regular passenger lines
    10-12 days for cargo and slower ships
In 1939, the Achilles journey from Alexandria to Boston (9'000 km) would be +60% distance going straight.
With zig-zagging through the Atlantic, let's say (10'000 km) +75% distance compared to Southampton -> New York.
We can expect faster ships at the end of 1930s.
So let's say it would be 12-14 days for Achilles going straight and 14-16 days when zig-zagging through the Atlantic.

"We'd be in Boston right now if we weren't zigzagging all over the bloody Atlantic."
That means the Baal boarding hapens near to the end of the journey - arround day 12-14 with 2 days remaining.
There could be some exageration in the statement, so maybo arround day 9-14 with 2-5 days remaining.
That would be 1939-09-03 to 1939-09-08.

France + UK declared war on Germany on 1939-09-03
"We're not at war yet" (= USA entered WW2 in 1941)






Achilles - captain's journal
September 1, 1939
The news reached us this morning: Germany has invaded Poland. Our orders are clear and remain unchanged: deliver the cargo to Boston, no questions asked. The men are uneasy, but discipline holds. The Achilles cuts through the waves, her course set, her cargo secured. The cargo shifts occasionally, a low metallic groan echoing through the hold. The crew casts glances, but no one asks. Not yet. 
I can’t shake the feeling that it’s more than just crates of machinery. The way the officers in Alexandria handed it over, the way they looked at me—this is something important.
The bosun grumbled about our zigzag pattern, but I won’t risk a straight line. U-boats lurk beneath these waters, and we’re a sitting duck if we don’t stay unpredictable. The bosun thinks I’m being paranoid, but I’ve seen what war does. I won’t let the Achilles be another casualty.



THOUGHTS: 
Core Crew (Small Cargo Ship, ~10–15 Total Crew)
1. Command & Navigation (Bridge)

Captain: Ultimate authority; responsible for navigation, safety, and cargo. Stands watch and makes all critical decisions.
Helmsman: Steers the ship, follows the captain’s orders for course and speed, and monitors instruments.
Communications Officer (Radio Operator): Handles all radio communications, including Morse code, distress signals, and contact with shore/other ships.
2. Deck Department

Bosun (Boatswain): Supervises deck crew, maintains the ship’s hull, rigging, and cargo. Often assists the captain with navigation and watches.
Able-Bodied Seaman (AB) x 2–3: Handle lines, operate winches, secure cargo, and perform general maintenance. Stand watch and assist the bosun.
Ordinary Seaman (OS) x 1–2: Junior crew; assist ABs, clean, and learn deck duties.
3. Engine Department

Chief Engineer: Oversees the ship’s engines, boilers, and mechanical systems. Performs repairs and ensures propulsion and auxiliary systems are operational.
Assistant Engineer x 1: Assists the chief engineer, stands watch in the engine room, and maintains machinery.
4. Steward’s Department

Cook/Steward: Prepares meals, manages provisions, and maintains the galley and crew quarters.

The men are restless. The radio crackles with reports of British and French declarations of war. The Atlantic feels narrower tonight, as if the conflict is closing in on us. I caught the bosun staring at the cargo hold again. He’s a good man, but curiosity will be the death of him—or worse, the death of us all.

I’ve ordered extra watches. The cargo shifts sometimes, a low groan of metal against wood. It’s unnerving. The helmsman swears he heard something inside one of the crates, but that’s impossible. Or is it? I’ve seen strange things in my time at sea, but this feels different. Like we’re carrying more than just steel and secrets.



THOUGHTS:
Almost a year earlier, Germany had seized the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia without resistance, backed by Britain and France, who hoped this concession would satisfy Hitler’s territorial ambitions. The Sudetenland—Czechoslovakia’s border regions, home to a mostly German population and its key fortifications—fell easily, leaving the country vulnerable. Thus, when Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, there was little resistance left.

On September 1, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland from opposite sides, using a staged attack as a pretext. Two days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany, but the Blitzkrieg had already overwhelmed Poland, and soon took France as well.

The war exploded in scale by 1941. Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor pulled the United States into the fight, while Germany betrayed its former ally, the Soviet Union. Nations took sides—some to stop tyranny, others to grab power. What began as a European conflict soon engulfed the world, leaving nothing unchanged.

The moon is full tonight, casting silver paths on the water. The crew is on edge. We’ve spotted nothing but empty ocean, yet the tension is thick enough to cut. The bosun asked again about the cargo. I told him what I always do: “No need to know.” He didn’t push, but I saw the frustration in his eyes.

I’ve taken to walking the deck at night, listening to the creaks and groans of the ship. The Achilles is old, but she’s sturdy. Still, I wonder if she’s up for whatever this cargo might bring. The war feels distant out here, but I know it’s coming for us all, one way or another.



THOUGHTS: 
The Merchant Marine moves cargo and passengers in peacetime and operates ships, tugs, ferries, and other vessels on oceans, lakes, and rivers. During war, it supports the U.S. Navy by transporting troops and military supplies.

Arround 2200 hours, the ship was struck by an unknown weapon, causing a large circular breach above the waterline on the port side. 
TODO: which side? 
The explosion was unlike anything I’ve seen—no torpedo wake, no shell impact, just a sudden hole through the hull.
The bosun and I investigated the cargo hold and found signs of a struggle. A few armed men, not of any known navy, were neutralized. The cargo remains secure, though I cannot explain how the intruders boarded or what they intended.
An unexpected ally appeared during the confrontation—a man who spoke as if he knew more than he should. He vanished as quickly as he came, leaving only questions. The bosun and I have agreed to log this as an attack by saboteurs, but the truth is far stranger.
We will make temporary repairs and continue straight to Boston. No word of this to the crew beyond what is necessary.



THOUGHTS:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_and_starboard
The term starboard comes from Old English stēorbord, meaning "steering side." Ancient ships were steered using a large wooden oar or paddle (the "steerboard") mounted on the right side of the vessel. Since most sailors were right-handed, the steerboard was placed on the right, making it the natural side for steering.
As ships evolved, the steerboard was replaced by a fixed rudder at the stern, but the name stuck. The right side of the ship became known as starboard.

The left side of the ship, where ships would typically dock to avoid damaging the steerboard, became known as the port side. The word "port" itself comes from the practice of docking on the left side to face the harbor (or "port")—this side was called the larboard in Old English, but it was eventually replaced by "port" to avoid confusion with "starboard."

This distinction became standardized to ensure clear communication on ships, regardless of a sailor’s orientation.
