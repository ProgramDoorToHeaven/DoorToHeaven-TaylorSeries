Captain Mitchell, United States Merchant Marine, Achilles ship
-> Boston, zigzagging all over the Atlantic to make it difficult to U-boats
"torpedo" hole, grandson Cameron Mitchell

Departed 1939-08-25 -ish.

In early 1930s, from Southampton to New York (5'700 km), it took:
    5-7 days for express passenger lines
    7-9 days for regular passenger lines
    10-12 days for cargo and slower ships
In 1939, the Achilles journey from Alexandria to Boston (9'000 km) would be +60% distance going straight.
With zig-zagging through the Atlantic, let's say (10'000 km) +75% distance compared to Southampton -> New York.
We can expect faster ships at the end of 1930s.
So let's say it would be 12-14 days for Achilles going straight and 14-16 days when zig-zagging through the Atlantic.

"We'd be in Boston right now if we weren't zigzagging all over the bloody Atlantic."
That means the Baal boarding hapens near to the end of the journey - arround day 12-14 with 2 days remaining.
There could be some exageration in the statement, so maybo arround day 9-14 with 2-5 days remaining.
That would be 1939-09-03 to 1939-09-08.

France + UK declared war on Germany on 1939-09-03
"We're not at war yet" (= USA entered WW2 in 1941)






Achilles - captain's journal
September 1, 1939
The news reached us this morning: Germany has invaded Poland. Our orders are clear and remain unchanged: deliver the cargo to Boston, no questions asked. The men are uneasy, but discipline holds. The Achilles cuts through the waves, her course set, her cargo secured. The cargo shifts occasionally, a low metallic groan echoing through the hold. The crew casts glances, but no one asks. Not yet. 
I can’t shake the feeling that it’s more than just crates of machinery. The way the officers in Alexandria handed it over, the way they looked at me—this is something important.
The bosun grumbled about our zigzag pattern, but I won’t risk a straight line. U-boats lurk beneath these waters, and we’re a sitting duck if we don’t stay unpredictable. The bosun thinks I’m being paranoid, but I’ve seen what war does. I won’t let the Achilles be another casualty.

The men are restless. The radio crackles with reports of British and French declarations of war. The Atlantic feels narrower tonight, as if the conflict is closing in on us. I caught the bosun staring at the cargo hold again. He’s a good man, but curiosity will be the death of him—or worse, the death of us all.
I’ve ordered extra watches. The cargo shifts sometimes, a low groan of metal against wood. It’s unnerving. The helmsman swears he heard something inside one of the crates, but that’s impossible. Or is it? I’ve seen strange things in my time at sea, but this feels different. Like we’re carrying more than just steel and secrets.

The moon is full tonight, casting silver paths on the water. The crew is on edge. We’ve spotted nothing but empty ocean, yet the tension is thick enough to cut. The bosun asked again about the cargo. I told him what I always do: “No need to know.” He didn’t push, but I saw the frustration in his eyes.
I’ve taken to walking the deck at night, listening to the creaks and groans of the ship. The Achilles is old, but she’s sturdy. Still, I wonder if she’s up for whatever this cargo might bring. The war feels distant out here, but I know it’s coming for us all, one way or another.
