A captain’s journal?
Now I’m grateful my uncle is obsessed with ships and never stops talking about them - I might actually understand what this is about!

Achilles - captain's journal
September 1, 1939

The news reached us this morning: Germany has invaded Poland. Our orders are
clear and remain unchanged: deliver the cargo to Boston, no questions asked. The
men are uneasy, but discipline holds. The Achilles cuts through the waves, her
course set, her cargo secured. The cargo shifts occasionally, a low metallic
groan echoing through the hold. The crew casts glances, but no one asks. Not
yet.

I can’t shake the feeling that it’s more than just crates of machinery. The way
the officers in Alexandria handed it over, the way they looked at me - this is
something important.

The bosun grumbled about our zigzag pattern, but I won’t risk a straight line.
U-boats lurk beneath these waters, and we’re a sitting duck if we don’t stay
unpredictable. The bosun thinks I’m being paranoid, but I’ve seen what war does.
I won’t let the Achilles be another casualty.

A small cargo ship like the Achilles typically operated with a lean crew of 10–15 members, each playing a critical role in the vessel’s operation.

On the bridge, the core team included the captain, who held ultimate authority and was responsible for navigation, safety, and cargo;
the helmsman, who steered the ship, followed the captain’s course and speed orders, and monitored instruments;
and the communications officer (radio operator), who managed all radio communications.

In the engine department, the chief engineer and assistant engineer oversaw the ship’s engines, boilers, and mechanical systems,
performing repairs and ensuring the propulsion and auxiliary systems remained operational.

A cook or steward handled meal preparation, managed provisions, and maintained the galley and crew quarters,
ensuring the crew was fed and living spaces were kept in order.

For general labor, maintenance, and cleaning, a small team of seamen worked under the bosun (boatswain),
who supervised the deck crew, maintained the ship’s hull, deck equipment, and cargo,
and often assisted the captain with navigation and watches.
This structure ensured the ship ran efficiently, even with a minimal crew.

The men are restless. The radio crackles with reports of British and French
declarations of war. The Atlantic feels narrower tonight, as if the conflict is
closing in on us. I caught the bosun staring at the cargo hold again. He’s a
good man, but curiosity will be the death of him - or worse, the death of us
all.

I’ve ordered extra watches. The cargo shifts sometimes, a low groan of metal
against wood. It’s unnerving. One of the boys swears he heard something inside
one of the crates, but that’s impossible. Or is it? I’ve seen strange things in
my time at sea, but this feels different. Like we’re carrying more than just
steel and secrets.

Almost a year earlier, Germany had seized the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia without resistance,
backed by Britain and France, who hoped this concession would satisfy Hitler’s territorial ambitions.
The Sudetenland - Czechoslovakia’s border regions, home to a mostly German population and its key fortifications - fell easily, leaving the country vulnerable.
Thus, when Germany invaded the rest of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, there was little resistance left.

On September 1, 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland from opposite sides, using a staged attack as a pretext.
Two days later, Britain and France declared war on Germany, but the Blitzkrieg had already overwhelmed Poland, and soon took France as well.

The war exploded in scale by 1941.
Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor pulled the United States into the fight, while Germany betrayed its former ally, the Soviet Union.
Nations took sides - some to stop tyranny, others to grab power.
What began as a European conflict soon engulfed the world, leaving nothing unchanged.

The moon is full tonight, casting silver paths on the water. The crew is on
edge. We’ve spotted nothing but empty ocean, yet the tension is thick enough to
cut. The bosun asked again about the cargo. I told him what I always do: "No
need to know." He didn’t push, but I saw the frustration in his eyes.

I’ve taken to walking the deck at night, listening to the creaks and groans of
the ship. The Achilles is old, but she’s sturdy. Still, I wonder if she’s up for
whatever this cargo might bring. The war feels distant out here, but I know it’s
coming for us all, one way or another.

The Merchant Marine, including ships like the Achilles - commanded by Captain Mitchell - primarily transports cargo and passengers during peacetime,
operating vessels such as freighters, tugs, and ferries across oceans, lakes, and rivers.
During wartime, it supports the U.S. Navy, delivering troops and military supplies, often under dangerous conditions.

Arround 2200 hours, the ship was struck by an unknown weapon, causing a large
circular breach above the waterline on the port side. The explosion was unlike
anything I’ve seen—no torpedo wake, no shell impact, just a sudden hole through
the hull.

The bosun and I investigated the cargo hold and found signs of a struggle. A few
armed men, not of any known navy, were neutralized. The cargo remains secure,
though I cannot explain how the intruders boarded or what they intended.

An unexpected ally appeared during the confrontation - a man who spoke as if he
knew more than he should. He vanished as quickly as he came, leaving only
questions. The bosun and I have agreed to log this as an attack by saboteurs,
but the truth is far stranger.

We will make temporary repairs and continue straight to Boston. No word of this
to the crew beyond what is necessary.

The term starboard comes from Old English stēorbord, meaning "steering side."
Ancient ships were steered using a large wooden oar or paddle (the "steerboard") mounted on the right side of the vessel.
Since most sailors were right-handed, the steerboard was placed on the right, making it the natural side for steering.
As ships evolved, the steerboard was replaced by a fixed rudder at the stern, but the name stuck.
The right side of the ship became known as starboard.

The left side of the ship, where ships would typically dock to avoid damaging the steerboard, became known as the port side.
The word "port" itself comes from the practice of docking on the left side to face the harbor (or "port") - this side was called the larboard in Old English,
but it was eventually replaced by "port" to avoid confusion with "starboard."

This distinction became standardized to ensure clear communication on ships, regardless of a sailor’s orientation.

Anyway, looks like the Germans tried to get their hands on the cargo, but luckilly, they didn't succeed.
