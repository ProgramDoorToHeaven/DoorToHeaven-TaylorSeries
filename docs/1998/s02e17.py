The meaning of one's life:
You have to find it on your own.
Asking others to help you find the meaning of life is like wanting them to eat when you are the one who is hungry.
It is about your own internal experience.

Masters of zen don't want to explain to you how water tastes. They want you to drink it.

Instead of words and phrases, express yourself.

Word is a finger pointing towards the Moon.
Do not confuse the finger with the Moon.
The language can only point towards an experience - it can't transfer an experience.

The more you try to relax, the less relaxed you are.

Meditation:
Passive part:
Do not continue the train of thoughts, but do not supress it.
Resign to your self, goals, and efforts.
Calm and open your mind.
Active part:
Vigilant attention to what is currently happening inside.
Think about your own thoughts dispassionately, with distance.
Living in the present moment.

Even if you meditate the same way Buddha did, you will not become Buddha.
If your cart stops, do not whip the cart, whip the draft animal.

Ten people swam over a river.
When they wanted to count themselves on the other side, each of them only counted nine.
Each forgot about themselves.
Don't forget that you are part of the world, and you can only experience it through your own mind.

Who are you? Where do you come from? Where are you heading?
